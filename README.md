# Ccxtex

Ccxtex package offers easy (presently somewhat brittle) Elixir/Erlang interoperability with python version of [ccxt library](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) that provides unified API to hisorical data and trading operations for multiple cryptocurrency exchanges including GDAX, Bitfinex, Poloniex, Binance and others.

## Changelog (v0.1 to v0.2)

* added exchanges supervisor to start a process for every exchanges
* added routing of calls to the corresponding exchange by default
* improved usability of function calls that now do not require a pid argument
* added specs to the all public functions

## Installation

### Elixir

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ccxtex, github: "cyberpunk-ventures/ccxtex"}
  ]
end
```

### Python

You need Python 3 and [ccxt](https://pypi.org/project/ccxt/) python package installed for this module to work.

To install ccxt use `pip3 install ccxt`

## Python interoperability

To provide querying of APIs in parallel and ease of per-exchange configuration, Ccxtex application includes a supervisor that starts and monitors an Erlport process and Python process for every exchange. Be mindful about the required system resources.

## Status and roadmap

Ccxtex is usable, but is under active development, API is unstable and will change. Some exchanges do not support all methods/require CORS/have other esoteric requirements. Please consult [ccxt documentation](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) for more.

### Public APIs in progress

- [x] fetch_ticker
- [x] fetch_ohlcv
- [x] fetch_exchanges
- [x] fetch_markets
- [ ] fetch_trades
- [ ] fetch_order_book
- [ ] fetch_l2_order_book

### Developer experience improvements

- [ ] unified public API call option structs
- [ ] investigate alternative parallelism/concurrency implementation
- [ ] capture exceptions generated by ccxt python library and convert to elixir success tuples
- [ ] improve general usability of library

### Private APIs implementation and authentication are under consideration

## Examples

Default process id (@pid) is Ccxtex.Port. You can always start and use another process with Ccxtex.Port.start_link/2

### Fetch exchanges

Usage:
`exchanges = Ccxtex.fetch_exchanges()`


```
